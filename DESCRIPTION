Description: Cookiecutter helps you generate project files
  and directories following a pre-made template.
  You can specify variables to customize file names and content, and
  flexibly adapt the template to your needs. Cookiecutter for R
  implements a subset of the excellent cookiecutter package for the
  Python programming language (<https://github.com/cookiecutter/>), and
  aims to be largely compatible with the original cookiecutter template
  format.
